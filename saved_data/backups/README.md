# Warning

This is a Kapytal backups folder. Kapytal creates backups of its data files here upon file open or file save. Please do not place any files in here.
In this folder, JSON files containing a "YYYY_mm_DD_HHhMMmSSs" timestamp at the end of their file name get automatically deleted by Kapytal over time. This happens any time the folder size limit defined in Kapytal settings is exceeded.
If you wish to store any of the files in this directory indefinitely, copy them elsewhere.
If you want Kapytal to stop using this folder for backups, remove this folder from backup directories in Kapytal settings. You can delete this folder afterwards.
