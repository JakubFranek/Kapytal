## What's the backstory behind Kapytal?

I started tracking my financial life in 2018 as I started investing. It seemed natural to extend the tracking from investments to day-to-day expenses as well (I think Quantified Self aka "self-knowledge through numbers" is quite cool and useful concept), and I looked for a suitable tool for this purpose. I eventually settled on using MoneyWiz 3, which fulfilled most of my criteria. However, the program was retired in 2021 or so and it slowly started to break. I was not able to find a suitable alternative and eventually decided to make one myself.

## What's the meaning of the name?

I was looking for a short yet meaningful name, one which would look and sound good but would not clash with existing projects or well known brand names. I think Kapytal fits the bill.
The word "capital" has a natural connection to money, the "py" refers to the fact that the program is written in Python, and the "K" stands for Kuba, which is the diminutive version of my first name.

## What's up with the capybara mascots?

In Czech, capybara is spelled "kapybara". My friend mentioned the similarity with my program's name, I played around a bit with Stable Diffusion and AI-generated kapytalist kapybaras were born.
