# Accounts

Accounts are key objects in Kapytal. Each transaction is related to one or two Accounts. The user can create Accounts, which represent various places where the user keeps money (bank accounts, physical wallets etc.). These Accounts can be grouped into Account Groups (essentially Account folders), which can again be grouped into another, higher-level group and so on.

There are two types of Accounts: the **CashAccount** and the **SecurityAccount**. The **CashAccount** contains some amount of a defined Currency, while the **SecurityAccount** is used for holding securities only and can contain no Currencies.
