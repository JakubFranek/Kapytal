### Account

Accounts are "vessels", capable of containing items of monetary value.

There are two types of Accounts: [Cash Accounts](#cash-account-), which contain money denominated in a certain [Currency](#currency-), and [Security Accounts](#security-account-), which contain shares of [Securities](#security-).

In Kapytal, Accounts are disambiguated by their [path](#path). Account hierarchy can be created within [Account Tree](#account-tree-) using [Account Groups](#account-group-)

---

### Account Group ![Icon](../resources/icons/icons-16/folder.png)

Account Groups are folders containing [Accounts](#account) or other Account Groups. There is no limit to the depth of nesting within the [Account Tree](#account-tree-). Account Groups are disambiguated by their [path](#path).

---

### Account Item

Account Item is an umbrella term for [Accounts](#account) and [Account Groups](#account-group-).

---

### Account Tree ![Icon](../resources/icons/icons-16/folder-tree.png)

Account Tree is the second largest user interface feature of Kapytal, and it is the used to create, browse, edit, delete or otherwise manipulate [Accounts](#account) and [Account Groups](#account-group-). It is also the place where the balances of all Accounts and Account Groups are visible in both their [native](#native-currencyamount) and [base](#base-currency) [Currencies](#currency-).

Account Tree also offers an intuitive interface shortcut to the Account [Transaction Filter](#transaction-filters-) via the check boxes in the rightmost Account Tree column. Only [Transactions](#transaction) related to the currently checked [Account Items](#account-item) are shown in the [Transaction Table](#transaction-table-).

Below the Account Tree there is a text label showing the total balance of currently selected Account Items in base Currency.

Account Tree can be hidden by toggling the ![Icon](../resources/icons/icons-16/folder-tree.png) *Show/Hide Account Tree* action in the toolbar. This is useful when more screen space for Transaction Table is required.

---

### Backups

Kapytal is creating backups of user JSON [data file](#data-file) every time the file is opened or saved. Backups are created in all the directories listed within the Backups tab in [Settings Form](#settings-form-). If the total size of all backups within any backup directory exceeds the size limit specified within the Settings Form Backups tab, Kapytal starts deleting backups in that particular directory until the limit is satisfied again, starting from the oldest backups. This backup size checking process occurs every time a backup is created. Details about the outcome of these backup checks can be found in the [logs](#logging).

---

### Base Currency

In Kapytal, exactly one Currency at a time can be designated as base Currency. Base Currency is used in *Base Balance* column and *Checked Account Balance* widget in [Account Tree](#account-tree-), *Base Amount* column and *Selected Transactions Total* widget in [Transaction Table](#transaction-table-), in [Securities](#securities-form), [Categories](#category-), [Payees](#payee-) and [Tags](#tag-) [Forms](#form) and in all [Reports](#reports).

The user can change the base Currency anytime in [Currencies Form](#currencies-form) in the Currencies section.

---

### Buy ![Icon](../resources/icons/icons-custom/certificate-plus.png)

Buy is a sub-type of [Security Transaction](#security-transaction) that represents the exchange of money from a [Cash Account](#cash-account-) for a gain of shares of a [Security](#security-) in a [Security Account](#security-account-). The keyboard shortcut for adding a Buy is the `B` key.

---

### Cash

In Kapytal, Cash is synonym for money denominated in a certain [Currency](#currency-), regardless of whether it is physical (coins, bank notes) or digital (bank accounts, cryptocurrencies etc.). Kapytal is not capable of making a distinction between a physical or digital money.

Related terms are: [Cash Account](#cash-account-), [Cash Transaction](#cash-transaction) and [Cash Transfer](#cash-transfer-).

---

### Cash Account ![Icon](../resources/icons/icons-16/piggy-bank.png)

Cash Account is a type of [Account](#account) that can contain any amount of money denominated in a certain [Currency](#currency-). When creating a Cash Account, its native [Currency](#currency-) is defined by the user and can never be changed.

In practice, Cash Accounts can be used to represent physical money (in a wallet, at home etc.) or digital money (current bank accounts, savings bank accounts, credit card accounts, cryptocurrency wallets etc.).

Cash Accounts can contain positive, zero, or even negative amounts of money. Negative balance can be expected in a Cash Account representing a credit card. After paying off the debt, the balance of such Cash Account should return to zero.

Cash Accounts are used in all types of [Transactions](#transaction) except [Security Transfers](#security-transfer-).

Cash Accounts can have a non-zero initial balance. In Kapytal, initial balance is considered effective the day before the first Transaction of the given Cash Account.

---

### Cash Flow Reports ![Icon](../resources/icons/icons-16/chart.png)

Cash Flow Reports are [Reports](#reports) used for analyzing the flow of your money within a given period. Monthly, Annual and Total Cash Flow Reports are available. The data is shown in two tabs: Table and Chart.

In Table tab, double-clicking on any table cell (or selecting a table cell and selecting ![Icon](../resources/icons/icons-16/table.png) *Show Transactions* action) brings up a [Transaction Table Form](#transaction-table-form), allowing the user to investigate the [Transactions](#transaction) used to calculate the selected quantity.

Evaluated quantities are:

+ [Income](#income-)
+ Inward Transfers
  + [Cash Transfers](#cash-transfer-), [Security Transactions](#security-transaction) and [Security Transfers](#security-transfer-) transferring value from [Cash Accounts](#cash-account-) or [Security Accounts](#security-account-) which are unselected in the [Account Tree](#account-tree-) to one of the selected [Account Items](#account-item)
+ [Refunds](#refund-)
+ Initial Balances
  + see [Cash Account](#cash-account-) for details
+ Total Inflow
+ [Expenses](#expense-)
+ Outward Transfers
  + same as Inward Transfers, but for value flowing out of the selected Account Items into the unselected Account Items
+ Total Outflow
+ Cash Flow
  + equal to $\text{Total Inflow} - \text{Total Outflow}$
  + Cash Flow is often more important than Net Growth, as the Gain/Loss part of Net Growth is usually beyond one's control
+ [Securities](#security-) Gain/Loss
+ [Currencies](#currency-) Gain/Loss
+ Total Gain/Loss
+ Net Growth
  + equal to $\text{Cash Flow} + \text{Total Gain/Loss}$
+ [Savings Rate](#savings-rate)

---

### Cash Transaction

Cash Transactions are [Transactions](#transaction) that represent the transfer of money between a [Cash Account](#cash-account-) and a [Payee](#payee-). There are two types of Cash Transactions: [Income](#income-) and [Expense](#expense-).

Cash Transactions can contain multiple [Categories](#category-) (so-called *"split Categories"*).

Cash Transaction specific attributes are: [Cash Account](#cash-account-), [Payee](#payee-), Amount and Categories.

---

### Cash Transfer ![Icon](../resources/icons/icons-custom/coins-arrow.png)

Cash Transfers are [Transactions](#transaction) that can transfer money from one [Cash Account](#cash-account-) to another. The [Currencies](#currency-) of the Cash Accounts do not have to match, and Cash Transfers can therefore represent Currency exchange operations.

Cash Transfer specific attributes are: Sender Cash Account, Recipient Cash Account, amount sent, amount received.

The keyboard shortcut for adding a Cash Transfer is the `Ctrl+T` combination (the mnemonic is: `Ctrl` for Cash and `T` for Transfer).

---

### Category ![Icon](../resources/icons/icons-custom/category.png)

Categories are attributes that can be used in [Cash Transactions](#cash-transaction) and [Refunds](#refund-). The user can create any amount of Categories, and Categories can form a tree-like hierarchy. The user can use Categories to filter [Transactions](#transaction) or create specific Category [Reports](#reports).

Each Category is defined by its [path](#path) and type (Income, Expense, Dual-Purpose). Income Categories can only be used in [Income](#income-) Cash Transactions, Expense Categories can only be used in [Expense](#expense-) Cash Transactions and Dual-Purpose Categories can be used in both Income and Expense Transactions.

Categories are meant to be generic and reused often. [Tags](#tag-) are better suited as an "one-off" attribute.

+ Example Income Categories: *Employment/Salary*, *Employment/Benefits*, *Employment/Bonus*, *Tax Refund*.
+ Example Expense Categories: *Food and Drink/Eating out*, *Food and Drink/Groceries*, *Bills/Heating*, *Health/Medicine*, *Housing/Rent*, *Housing/Equipment/Kitchen*, *Transport/Airplane*, *Car/Fuel*, *Car/Repairs*, *Clothes/Accessories*, *Sports/Equipment*, *Leisure/Culture/Theatre*.
+ Example Dual-Purpose Categories: *Interest*, *Gift*.

Contrary to many similar software, in Kapytal, the user can assign Categories to Cash Transactions regardless of how many children the Categories have. For example, the user can use Category *Food and Drink* as well as *Food and Drink/Eating out*, and both could be even assigned to the same Cash Transactions at the same time.

Cash Transactions can include one or more Categories.

---

### Currencies Form

Currencies Form is the [Form](#form) for creating, editing, deleting, manipulating and updating [Currencies](#currency-), [Exchange Rates](#exchange-rate-) and Exchange Rate quotes. It also allows the user to set the [base Currency](#base-currency).

---

### Currency ![Icon](../resources/icons/icons-custom/currency.png)

In Kapytal, Currencies are units of money. The user can create and delete Currencies in [Currencies Form](#currencies-form). Currencies have two attributes: code and number of decimals. These two attributes are specified upon Currency creation and can never be changed.

Code is a 3-letter string, as the intended contents are the [ISO 4217](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217) standard codes (such as USD, EUR etc.). However, in practice, the user can enter any three letter string. Kapytal Currencies can therefore be used to represent non-standard currencies such as cryptocurrencies (BTC, ETH) or any other unit of monetary value.

Number of decimals represents the number of digits after the decimal separator for the given Currency. Most currencies have 2 decimals (see column D [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217#List_of_ISO_4217_currency_codes)). Cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum can however have up to 18 decimals. Kapytal therefore supports up to 18 decimal places. In general, Kapytal does not allow the user to specify amounts with more decimals than the specified Currency number of decimals, with the exception of [Security](#security-) price. When specifying Security Amount per Share in [Securities Form](#securities-form) or [Security Transactions](#security-transaction), Kapytal allows the user to enter the price with greater precision than the number of digits of the given Currency. The precision can be set within [Settings Form](#settings-form-).

In Kapytal, exactly one Currency at a time can be designated as [base Currency](#base-currency).

To represent Currency exchange, use [Cash Transfers](#cash-transfer-), as the sending and receiving Cash Accounts do not have to have the same Currency.

---

### Data File

Data File is a term for the JSON files created, viewed and edited by Kapytal. An example of such a file is the [demo file](#demo-file).

---

### Date

All [Transactions](#transaction) contain date attribute, as well as [Security](#security-) price and [Exchange Rate](#exchange-rate-) quotes.

The user can set the format of date attributes in [Settings Form](#settings-form-), separately for Transactions and for other purposes. This is because under the hood, Transaction dates also contain hours, minutes and seconds, which are hidden by default. Setting a date format which contains hours, minutes or seconds can show them within the Transaction Table. This can be useful when reordering Transactions using the hours and minutes, as Transaction creation/edit dialogs date widgets contain hours and minutes. Seconds are not editable, as they are reserved for Kapytal's internal purposes.

---

### Demo Files

Demo files are JSON [data file](#data-file) distributed within Kapytal installation and can be found at `<installation_directory>/Kapytal/_internal/saved_data/` or [here](../saved_data/). They contain fictitous data and showcase the typical usage of Kapytal features.

---

### Description

Descriptions are optional strings describing [Transactions](#transaction). They can be multi-line and up to 256 characters long.

---

### Dialog

In Kapytal, Dialogs are "disposable" user interface elements/windows used for simple data entry tasks (note this is not a clear cut definition). Dialogs usually disappear after accepting them.

---

### Dividend ![Icon](../resources/icons/icons-custom/certificate-coin.png)

Dividend is a sub-type of [Security Transaction](#security-transaction) that represents the gain of money in a [Cash Account](#cash-account-) which is connected to a [Security](#security-) from a [Security Account](#security-account-), but which does not change the amount of shares held in the Security Account. The keyboard shortcut for adding a Dividend is the `Shift+D` key combination, as `D` is reserved for the *Duplicate Transaction* action (as a mnemonic, the `Shift` stands for Security, just like in the [Security Transfer](#security-transfer-) shortcut).

Dividends are included in the Total and Realized performance shown in the Overview tab of the [Securities Form](#securities-form).

---

### Exchange Rate ![Icon](../resources/icons/icons-custom/currency-arrow.png)

Exchange Rates relate two [Currencies](#currency-) together through a numerical conversion factor. Exchange Rates can be created within [Currencies Form](#currencies-form).

Both current or past values of Exchange Rates can be set manually within [Currencies Form](#currencies-form). Current rates can also be downloaded automatically via [Update Quotes Form](#update-quotes-form-).

The number of decimals of Exchange Rate quote dialog spinboxes can be set within [Settings Form](#settings-form-).

---

### Expense ![Icon](../resources/icons/icons-custom/coins-minus.png)

Expense is a sub-type of [Cash Transaction](#cash-transaction), which represents the transfer of money from a [Cash Account](#cash-account-) to a [Payee](#payee-). Unlike [Income](#income-), Expense can be refunded by a [Refund](#refund-). Once an Expense is refunded, it cannot be edited until the Refunds are deleted. The keyboard shortcut for adding an Expense is the `E` key.

---

### Form

In Kapytal, Forms are user interface elements/windows used for more complex settings and operations (note this is not a clear cut definition). Operations within Forms usually create [Dialogs](#dialog) in the process.

These are some of the Forms in Kapytal:

+ [Categories](#category-) Form
+ [Currencies Form](#currencies-form)
+ [Payees](#payee-) Form
+ [Update Quotes Form](#update-quotes-form-)
+ [Securities Form](#securities-form)
+ [Settings Form](#settings-form-)
+ [Tags](#tag-) Form
+ [Transaction Filter](#transaction-filters-) Form
+ [Transaction Table Form](#transaction-table-form)

---

### Income ![Icon](../resources/icons/icons-custom/coins-plus.png)

Income is a sub-type of [Cash Transaction](#cash-transaction), which represents the transfer of money from a [Payee](#payee-) to a [Cash Account](#cash-account-). Unlike [Expense](#expense-), Income cannot be [refunded](#refund-). The keyboard shortcut for adding an Income is the `I` key.

---

### Logging

Most operations the user makes within Kapytal are logged in a log file. These files are used for debugging purposes and can be found within `<installation_directory>/Kapytal/_internal/logs/`.

The user can set the maximum logs directory size in [Settings Form](#settings-form-). If exceeded, Kapytal will start deleting logs during startup, starting from the oldest logs, until the limit is satisfied. The details about the outcome of this deletion process can be naturally found in the most recent log.

---

### Native Currency/Amount

The [Currency](#currency-) of a [Cash Account](#cash-account-) or a [Security](#security-) is considered to be its native Currency.

In the [Account Tree](#account-tree-), the balance of all Cash Accounts is shown in both native and [base](#base-currency) Currency, unless the native Currency of the particular Cash Account matches the base Currency. In that case, native balance is empty (as it would be identical to base amount anyway).

If all Securities contained within a [Security Account](#security-account-) are denominated in the same non-base Currency, the balance of the Security Account is shown in the Currency of the Securities in the Account Tree *Native Balance* column.

In the [Transaction Table](#transaction-table-), Native Amount and Base Amount are two separate columns. Native Amount displays the amount of all [Transactions](#transaction), which are denominated in a Currency different from the base Currency (except the [Cash Transfer](#cash-transfer-) and [Security Transfer](#security-transfer-) Transactions, which utilize different columns altogether).

In the [Securities Form](#securities-form) Overview tab tree, there are several performance indicators which are denominated in the native Currency of the given Security.

---

### Net Worth Reports ![Icon](../resources/icons/icons-16/chart-pie.png)

Net Worth Reports are [Reports](#reports) used for high level overview of total financial assets.

Net Worth Reports only take [Account Items](#account-item) passing through the Account Filter into account (they do not operate on [Transactions](#transaction)).

There are three Net Worth Reports:

+ Accounts
  + used for visualizing how much each Account Item from [Account Tree](#account-tree-) is worth
+ Asset Type
  + used for calculating and visualizing how much net worth within selected Account Items consists of money denominated in specific [Currencies](#currency-) or money tied up in specific [Securities](#security-)
+ Time
  + used for visualizing the time evolution of the balance of selected Account Items

---

### Path

In Kapytal, items in tree-like hierarchies ([Account Items](#account-item) or [Categories](#category-)) are identified by their path. The path string consists of item names separated by slashes, starting from root item: `Grandparent/Parent/Child`.

---

### Payee ![Icon](../resources/icons/icons-16/user-business.png)

Payee is an attribute appearing in [Cash Transactions](#cash-transaction) and represents the other party of the Cash Transactions. Payees are identified only by their name, which can contain any symbols excluding colons (:).

In case of [Income](#income-), the Payee could be an employer, customer, the bank paying the user savings account interest, the government sending them the tax refund etc. In case of [Expense](#expense-), the Payee could be a landlord, telephone company, local grocery shop, gym etc.

Payees can be used to filter Cash Transactions or create specific Payee [Reports](#reports).

---

### Refund ![Icon](../resources/icons/icons-custom/coins-arrow-back.png)

Refund is a special type of [Transaction](#transaction) that "reverts" the effects of an [Expense](#expense-). The user can create a Refund by right-clicking an Expense in [Transaction Table](#transaction-table-) and selecting *Add Refund*, or by selecting an Expense and pressing the `R` key.

Refunds can refund the Expense fully or partially. Each Refund can relate to only one Expense, while each Expense can be refunded by multiple Refunds. However, the total sum of refunded money cannot exceed the total amount defined by the Expense.

Refunds can refund money to a different [Cash Account](#cash-account-) than the Cash Account defined in the refunded Expense. The [date & time](#date) of a Refund cannot precede the date & time of the refunded Expense.

To find Refund's refunded Expense, or to find refunded Expense's Refunds, right-click the chosen Transaction and select *Find related*.

For the purposes of most [Reports](#reports), Refunds are either treated separately, or as "inverted" Expense. Refunds are only considered as [Income](#income-) in the [Categories](#category-) Report sunburst chart, because this chart type is incapable of visualizing negative values (Refunds would be ideally considered negative Expense).

---

### Reports

Reports are used to analyse and visualize your data using charts and tables. Reports can be accessed via the *Reports* menu item.

Note reports always analyse only the [Transactions](#transaction) or [Account Items](#account-item) that are passing through [Transaction Filters](#transaction-filters-). The user can use this to purposefully remove some Transactions from the analysed data set.

There are several types of Reports:

+ [Net Worth Reports](#net-worth-reports-)
+ [Cash Flow Reports](#cash-flow-reports-)
+ Category Reports
+ Tag Reports
+ Payee Reports

---

### Savings Rate

Savings Rate is a quantity evaluated in [Cash Flow Reports](#cash-flow-reports-).

Savings Rate quantifies saved money relative to the sum of all saveable money for a given period. [Refunds](#refund-) contribute towards the saved amount, but not towards the saveable amount, therefore Savings Rate of more than 100% is theoretically possible.

The formula is: $\text{Savings Rate} = \text{Cash Flow} / (\text{Income} + \text{Inward Transfers}) = (\text{Inflows} - \text{Outflows}) / (\text{Inflows} - \text{Refunds})$

---

### Securities Form

Securities Form is the [Form](#form) for creating, editing, deleting, manipulating and updating [Securities](#securities-form) and their price quotes.

In the Overview tab, an overview of Securities and all [Security Accounts](#security-account-) which contain their shares is available, including a large number of performance related quantities.

Some performance quantities are available in the following "flavors":

+ Realized (R)
  + actual performance based on paid-out [Dividends](#dividend-) and completed [Sell](#sell-) [Transactions](#transaction)
+ Unrealized (U)
  + virtual performance which could hypothetically be realized if all owned Security shares were sold for market price
+ Total (T)
  + sum of realized and unrealized performance

Some performance quantities are available in [base](#base-currency) and/or [native](#native-currencyamount) [Currencies](#currency-). This means that the quantities are calculated using base or native $\text{Avg. Buy Price}$ or $\text{Avg. Sell Price}$ respectively. These quantities are different, even after [Exchange Rate](#exchange-rate-) conversion! This is because $\text{Avg. Buy Price}$ and $\text{Avg. Sell Price}$ take the Exchange Rates for the given Transaction [date](#date) into account, and they are therefore affected by the Exchange Rate history. For more details, [see this FAQ question](./faq.md#in-securities-form-overview-tab-tree-why-do-the-quantities-denominated-in-native-and-base-currencies-sometimes-not-match-after-converting-them-with-the-latest-exchange-rate-to-base-currency-why-are-native-and-base-currency-returns-different).

Following performance quantities are available:

+ Gain
  + available in base and native Currencies
  + available in Realized, Unrealized and Total flavors
    + $\text{Realized Gain} = \text{Shares Sold} * (\text{Avg. Sell Price} - \text{Avg. Buy Price}) + \text{Dividends}$
    + $\text{Unrealized Gain} = \text{Shares Owned} * (\text{Market Price} - \text{Avg. Buy Price})$
    + $\text{Total Gain} = \text{Realized Gain} + \text{Unrealized Gain}$
+ Currency Gain
  + available only in base Currency
  + available only in Total flavor
    + $\text{Total Currency Gain} = \text{Total Base Gain} - \text{Total Native Gain}$
+ Return
  + relative return in percent
  + available in base and native Currencies
  + available in Realized, Unrealized and Total flavors
    + $\text{Realized Return} = \frac{\text{Shares Sold} * (\text{Avg. Sell Price} - \text{Avg. Buy Price})}{\text{Shares Sold} * \text{Avg. Buy Price}}+\frac{\text{Dividends}}{\text{Shares Bought} * \text{Avg. Buy Price}}$
    + $\text{Unrealized Return} = \frac{\text{Unrealized Gain}}{\text{Shares Owned} * \text{Avg. Buy Price}}$
    + $\text{Total Return} = \frac{\text{Total Gain}}{\text{Avg. Buy Price} * \text{Shares Bought}}$
+ Annualized [Internal Rate of Return (IRR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_rate_of_return)
  + available in base and native Currencies
  + available only in Total flavor
  + calculated using the [`pyxirr`](https://pypi.org/project/pyxirr/) package `xirr` function, which takes the dates of Security Transactions into account
  
---

### Security ![Icon](../resources/icons/icons-16/certificate.png)

Securities are used to represent assets with a monetary value which fluctuates over time, such as stocks, bonds, ETFs, pension funds or other financial instruments, as well as real estate, [mortgages](./faq.md#how-to-handle-a-mortgage-in-kapytal), loans, cars, art etc.

In Kapytal, shares of Securities can be owned within [Security Accounts](#security-account-), can be acquired or sold via [Security Transactions](#security-transaction), and can be transfered to other Security Accounts via [Security Transfers](#security-transfer-).

Price history of Securities can be tracked by Kapytal. Prices for a specific calendar day can be entered manually, loaded from a CSV file in [Securities Form](#securities-form), or updated automatically in [Update Quotes Form](#update-quotes-form-).

When creating a Security in Securities Form, following attributes are requested:

+ Name
+ Symbol
  + optional, but required for automatic price updates via [Update Quotes Form](#update-quotes-form-)
+ Type
  + custom string of your own choosing (for example *ETF*, *Real Estate*, *Pension Fund* etc.)
+ Shares decimals
  + number of decimal places of shares
  + typically 0 decimal places (integer amount of Shares), but more decimals are needed for Securities with fractional shares
+ [Currency](#currency-)
  + Currency of the Security price as well as the Currency which will be used when buying or selling shares

---

### Security Account ![Icon](../resources/icons/icons-16/bank.png)

Security Account is a type of [Account](#account) that can contain shares of [Securities](#security-). Unlike [Cash Accounts](#cash-account-), which can contain only money of single [Currency](#currency-), Security Accounts can contain shares of any number of various Securities, and the Securities do not even have to be denominated in the same Currency.

There is no Currency associated with Security Accounts. In [Account Tree](#account-tree-), their balance is shown in terms of the [base Currency](#base-currency). [Native](#native-currencyamount) balance of a Security Account is shown only when all Securities within are denominated in the same non-base Currency.

In practice, Security Accounts can be used to represent investment, trading or pension accounts, but also real estate portfolio, car collection, art collection or any group of assets whose fluctuating value the user wants to track in Kapytal.

Security Accounts can contain positive, zero, or even negative amounts of shares of any Security. Negative amounts of shares are useful for modelling loans and [mortgages](./faq.md#how-to-handle-a-mortgage-in-kapytal).

To see the Security contained within a Security Account, double-click the Security Account in the Account Tree or right-click the Security Account in the Account Tree and select *Show Securities* option from the context menu. The contents of a Security Account can also be seen from a different point of view by navigating to Edit/Securities form and switching to the *Overview* tab.

Security Accounts are used in [Security Transactions](#security-transaction) and [Security Transfers](#security-transfer-).

---

### Security Transaction

Security Transactions are [Transactions](#transaction) that represent buying or selling shares of a [Security](#security-) in exchange for monetary value. There are three sub-types of Security Transactions: [Buy](#buy-), [Sell](#sell-) and [Dividend](#dividend-).

Security Transaction specific attributes are: [Cash Account](#cash-account-), [Security Account](#security-account-), Security, shares, Amount per Share.

---

### Security Transfer ![Icon](../resources/icons/icons-custom/certificate-arrow.png)

Security Transfers are [Transaction](#transaction) that can transfer shares of a [Security](#security-) from one [Security Account](#security-account-) to another.

Security Transfer specific attributes are: Sender Security Account, Recipient Security Account, Security, shares.

The keyboard shortcut for adding a Security Transfer is the `Shift+T` combination (the mnemonic is: `Shift` for Security and `T` for Transfer).

---

### Sell ![Icon](../resources/icons/icons-custom/certificate-minus.png)

Sell is a sub-type of [Security Transaction](#security-transaction) that represents the exchange of shares of a [Security](#security-) from a [Security Account](#security-account-) for a gain of money in a [Cash Account](#cash-account-). The keyboard shortcut for adding a Sell is the `S` key.

Note Kapytal allows negative shares of a Security within Security Account, i.e. it is possible to use Sell to sell shares of Security from a Security Account that does not contain any shares of that Security at all. This can be leveraged for [modelling mortgages](./faq.md#how-to-handle-a-mortgage-in-kapytal).

---

### Settings Form ![Icon](../resources/icons/icons-16/gear.png)

Settings Form is used to change the following internal Kapytal settings:

+ Check for updates on startup
  + when checked, Kapytal attempts to connect to GitHub on each startup to check whether there are any new releases available
  + default value: checked
+ Exchange Rate decimals
  + number of decimals available when manually setting Exchange Rate value in [Currencies Form](#currencies-form)
  + default value: 4
+ Amount per Share decimals
  + number of decimals available in the [Security Transaction](#security-transaction) dialogs in the Amount per Share spinbox
  + default value: 4
+ General date format
  + formatting string used for formatting [dates](#date), with the exception of [Transaction Table](#transaction-table-) Date column (see below)
  + default value: `%d.%m.%Y`
+ Transaction Table date format
  + formatting string used for formatting dates in the Date column of the Transaction Table
  + default value: `%d.%m.%Y`

  + default value is set automatically during first start up based on system locale
+ Maximum [backup](#backups) directory size
  + maximum size of each backup directory before Kapytal starts deleting backups, starting from the oldest
  + default value: 100,000 kB

### Tag ![Icon](../resources/icons/icons-16/tag.png)

Tags are attributes that can be used in any [Transaction](#transaction). The user can create any amount of Tags. Tags are identified only by their name, which can contain any symbols excluding colons (:). The user can use Tags to filter Transactions or create specific Tag [Reports](#reports).

Tags can be used to distinguish Transactions related to certain events (*vacation Greece 06/2023*, *Christmas 2019*, *my wedding*, *dates with Eve*, *house renovation 2017*), people (*baby*, *friends*, *together*), places (*7 Sunny Street* - for example when the user wants to distinguish all Transactions related to their house), Transactions the user wants someone to repay them for (*Adam owes me*) etc.

Tags are not meant for describing the object of the Transactions (i.e. *Groceries*, *Electronics*, *Rent* etc.) as that is the purpose of [Categories](#category-).

Note that [Cash Transactions](#cash-transaction) and [Refunds](#refund-) support the *"split Tags"* functionality, which allows the user to specify the monetary amount which should be associated with the given Tag. By default, full Transaction amount is associated with the Tag, but split Tags can be used to alter this to a lower amount. This feature is useful for splitting expenses (see the basic [demo file](#demo-files) for example of this usage).

Note that for the purposes of Tag Reports, only [Income](#income-), [Expense](#expense-), [Refund](#refund-) and [Dividend](#dividend-) Transaction amounts are considered in the calculation. This is because other Transaction types are expected to be value-neutral.

### Transaction

Transactions are used to represent all real-world Transactions the user has made.

There are several types of Transactions: [Cash Transactions](#cash-transaction), [Cash Transfers](#cash-transfer-), [Refunds](#refund-), [Security Transactions](#security-transaction) and [Security Transfers](#security-transfer-).

All Transaction types contain the following attributes: [Date](#date), [Description](#description) and [Tags](#tag-).

---

### Transaction Filters ![Icon](../resources/icons/icons-16/funnel.png)

Transaction Filters are used to filter [Transactions](#transaction) based on specific criteria. Transaction Filter Form can be accessed by clicking on the funnel icon next to the [Transaction Table](#transaction-table-) search bar.

There are many Transaction Filters:

+ Transaction Type Filter
+ [Date](#date) Filter
+ [Description](#description) Filter
+ Account Filter
  + mostly accessed directly from the [Account Tree](#account-tree-) check boxes
  + this filter filters Transactions based on the [Account Items](#account-item) they relate to, but it also filters the Account Items themselves for [Net Worth Report](#net-worth-reports-) purposes
+ [Tag](#tag-) Filters
  + Tag-less Transaction Filter
  + Specific Tag Filter
  + Split Tags Transaction Filter
+ [Category](#category-) Filters
  + Specific Category Filter
  + Split Category Filter
+ [Payee](#payee-) Filter
+ [Currency](#currency-) Filter
+ Cash Amount Filter
+ [Security](#security-) Filter
+ [UUID](#uuid) Filter

Transaction Filters are chained one after another, and only Transactions passing through all active filters are shown in the Transaction Table.

Many Transaction Filters have three "modes": `OFF`, `KEEP` and `DISCARD`. Filters which are `OFF` do not discard any Transactions. Filters which are set to `KEEP` mode keep the Transactions which satisfy their criteria, while filters set to `DISCARD` mode do the opposite of `KEEP` mode filters and discard the Transactions which satisfy their criteria instead.

### Transaction Table ![Icon](../resources/icons/icons-16/table.png)

Transaction Table is the dominant user interface feature of Kapytal, and it is the interface element used to create, browse, edit, delete or otherwise manipulate [Transactions](#transaction).

Transaction Table contains many columns, some of which are not shown by default. The columns can be manipulated via the context menu shown by right-clicking on the Transaction Table column headers. The columns can also be reordered or stretched by manually dragging the headers or header edges respectively.

Below the Transaction Table, there are two text labels. First label shows the amount of currently shown Transactions out of the total amount of Transactions. Transactions can be hidden from Transaction Table via [Transaction Filters](#transaction-filters-). Second label shows the sum of the amounts of currently selected Transactions. Please note only [Income](#income-), [Expense](#expense-), [Refund](#refund-) and [Dividend](#dividend-) amounts are summed.

Transaction Table can be hidden by toggling the ![Icon](../resources/icons/icons-16/table.png) *Show/Hide Transaction Table* action in the toolbar.

### Transaction Table Form

Transaction Table Form is a small and less-capable version of the [Transaction Table](#transaction-table-) which can be opened in various [Reports](#reports) and [Categories](#category-), [Payees](#payee-) and [Tags](#tag-) [Forms](#form). Transaction Table Form contains all the [Transactions](#transaction) that are related to the selected Report or Form item. Transaction Table Form supports editing and adding or removing Tags.

---

### UUID

Universally Unique IDentifier is a string of characters which unambiguously identifies an object.

In Kapytal, all [Transactions](#transaction) have an UUIDv4, which can be shown in the [Transaction Table](#transaction-table-) by right-clicking the Transaction Table header and enabling the UUID column in the context menu. Transaction UUIDs can also be copied to clipboard by right-clicking selected Transactions in the Transaction Table and selecting the *Copy UUIDs* action in the context menu. The user can paste the clipboard contents into the UUID [Transaction Filter](#transaction-filters-) directly.

Under the hood, all [Account Items](#account-item), [Securities](#security-) and [Categories](#category-) are also assigned an UUID. Account Item and Security UUIDs can be found in the JSON [data file](#data-file), while Category UUIDs are assigned randomly during program runtime for internal purposes.

### Update Quotes Form ![Icon](../resources/icons/icons-16/arrow-circle-double.png)

Update Quotes Form is a [Form](#form) used to fetch latest [Security](#security-) price and [Exchange Rate](#exchange-rate-) data from Yahoo Finance. Only Securities with non-empty symbol strings are eligible for price update. The Security symbol must match the symbol used for the given Security on Yahoo Finance.

Please note the first quote download after starting Kapytal can take a while (but usually less than 1 minute).
