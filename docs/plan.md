# Development plan

## Option 1 - Iterative approach

1. Create minimum viable back-end and test it thoroughly
    - for example only basic Transaction and Account support
2. Create PyQt GUI for this back-end and test it thoroughly
3. Add more features to the back-end
4. Add GUI support for new features
5. Repeat step 3 until no more sensible features can be thought of
6. Make and distribute the installer
7. Use the tool

## Option 2 - Top-down approach

1. Create feature-complete back-end and test it thoroughly
2. Create PyQt GUI for this back-end and test it thoroughly
3. Make and distribute the installer
4. Use the tool

Either way...

- Start with at least the minimum viable back-end
- Test thoroughly
- Refactor along the way to keep codebase clean
